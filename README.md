# PartMaster

PartMaster is a computer vision project  designed to  identify and categorize various car components using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks . This project is aimed at providing a solution for automating car part recognition tasks, with potential applications in the automotive industry, inventory management, maintenance, and more.

## Overview

Car Part Recognition employs deep learning techniques, specifically the Inception-ResNet architecture, to achieve accurate part recognition. Key components of this project include:

### 1. Deep Learning Model

The core of the project is a deep learning model trained to recognize different car parts. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of car part images to ensure accurate identification.

### 2. Flask Web Application

The project includes a  Flask-based web application. Users can upload images of car parts via the web interface, and the model provides real-time predictions, identifying the specific part in the image.
