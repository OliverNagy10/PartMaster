# PartMaster

PartMaster is a computer vision project developed for identifying and recognizing various car parts. This project focuses on providing a practical solution for the automotive industry, including tasks such as inventory management and maintenance.

## Overview

Car Part Recognition employs deep learning techniques, specifically the Inception-ResNet architecture, to achieve accurate part recognition. Key components of this project include:

### 1. Deep Learning Model

The core of the project is a deep learning model trained to recognize different car parts. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of car part images to ensure accurate identification.

### 2. Flask Web Application

The project includes a  Flask-based web application. Users can upload images of car parts via the web interface, and the model provides real-time predictions, identifying the specific part in the image.
